# Hunt-The-Wumpus
A text based rendition of the game "Hunt the Wumpus" in Python

You are in a network of caves, hunting down a Wumpus!

Using the menu, you must navigate the network, only being able to move to the adjacent room
Upon being close to the Wumpus room, you "will smell something terrible nearby"
You are then able to fire you arrows to kill them
If you enter the room that the Wumpus is in, they will either run away or kill you

Enjoy the game!

(This is one of my neater pieces of code, I'm rather pleased at how concise it is and how the multi-layer pentagon network of rooms has been represented as a data structure)
